Postgresql is one of the most popular flavors of SQL. Streamlit provides an officially supported postgresql connection adapter.

- It can be installed via `pip install streamlit-connect-postgres`
- Source code and more docs can be found at [github.com/streamlit/connect-postgres](http://github.com/streamlit/connect-postgres)

The connection adapter is built on psycopg2-binary, alternative community supported adapters can be found [here](#).

conn = st.connection('postgresql')

df = conn.query('select * from ab_data order by random() limit 500')
st.dataframe(df)

AWS S3 is one of the most popular cloud file stores in use today, and frequently used for storing unstructured or semi-structured
datasets as well as model files.

**You can view our full guide to AWS S3 connections [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/databases/aws-s3).**

## Prerequisites

The S3 connector uses the [AWS Boto3 library](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html) installable with pip

```sh
pip install boto3
```
**Credentials**

You will also need to provision AWS credentials, either through the AWS browser console or with support from your system administrator.
Typically a minimum set of credentials include the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. Any region value, such as `us-east-1`,
will usually work for S3 although not for all other AWS services!

        """
Please remember to ensure boto3 is installed for your app before attempting to use the connector!

```sh
pip install boto3
```

If everything is set up correctly, you can get started with just a few lines of code:

```python
import streamlit as st
conn = st.connection('aws_s3', bucket='s3://my_bucket')

st.dataframe(conn.get_object('awesome_data.csv'))
```

Press the button below to get started with an example S3 app that works with public data.
